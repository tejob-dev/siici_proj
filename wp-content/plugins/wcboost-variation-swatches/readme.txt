== Why you need variation swatches for your store? ==

The default WooCommerce dropdowns are not very appealing and user-friendly. They can cause some problems for your customers, such as:

- Default variation dropdowns do not provide any visual feedback of the product variations, making it hard for customers to find the right option.
- They can reduce the conversion rate of your product page, as customers may lose interest or get confused by the dropdowns.

== How this plugin can help you improve your store? ==

WCBoost ‚Äì Variation Swatches can solve these problems and provides some benefits for your customers:

- They provide a visual representation of the product variations, making it easy for customers to see and select the right option.
- They can increase the conversion rate of your product page, as customers can be more engaged and satisfied by the swatches.

== Key features of the WCBoost Variation Swatches plugin ==

This plugin has all the features that other WooCommerce variation swatches plugins have, and more. It also includes many features that make it the best plugin to display WooCommerce product variations in style.

- **Auto convert all variation dropdowns to button swatches**

  This plugin can automatically convert all your variation dropdowns to button swatches by default, without having to create swatches for each attribute manually. If you want to restore the default dropdown, you just need to disable this option.

- **Supports color, image, label, and button swatches for product attributes.**

  You can use swatches of color, image, label, or button to show the different options of your products. For example, you can use color swatches to show the available colors of a shirt, image swatches to show the different patterns of a dress, label swatches to show the sizes of a shoe, or button swatches to show the styles of a hat.

- **Customizable style of swatches, such as shape, size, tooltip, etc.**

  You can control the style of swatches, such as shape, size, border, spacing, alignment, etc. You can also enable tooltip for swatches, which can show the name or description of the attribute.

- **Enable tooltip for swatches**

  You can enable tooltip to show more details of your swatches. The tooltip feature will show the attribute name and the option name when the user hovers over the swatch.

- **Allows global or individual management of attribute swatches.**

  You can create and display swatches for both global product attributes and custom attributes in each singular product. Global product attributes are the attributes that you create and manage in the Products ‚Üí Attributes, and apply to multiple products. Custom attributes are the attributes that you create and assign to each individual product. You can use both types of attributes to create swatches for your products, and customize them separately.

- **Allow customizing swatches per product**

  You can use the plugin to customize swatches per product, and override the global settings for swatches of each product attribute. You can change the style, size of your swatches for each product.

- **Hide/blur invalid swatches**

  Hiding invalid swatches is essential for a streamlined user experience. Invalid swatches are the ones that do not match the current selection of the other attributes. For example, if you have a product with two attributes, color and size, and you select red as the color, the plugin will hide or blur the swatches that are not available in red, such as XL or XXL. This will help you to avoid confusing your customers with unavailable options, and improve your conversion rate.

- **Easy to use with the simple interface**

  Never mess up the admin area with additional menus. The plugin does not add any additional menus to your admin area, and integrates seamlessly with the WooCommerce settings and product pages. You can create and manage your swatches from the same place where you create and manage your products and attributes, and use the plugin‚Äôs settings to customize your swatches globally or per product.

- **Seamlessly integrated with all themes and easy to customize**

  You can use the plugin with most WordPress themes, and it will work flawlessly. The plugin is designed to adapt to your theme‚Äôs style and layout. You can also use the plugin‚Äôs settings or custom CSS to further customize your swatches to match your theme‚Äôs design. It also supports multilingual and RTL websites.

- **Provide API that allows themes and plugins to extend easily**

  You can use the plugin‚Äôs API to extend its functionality and compatibility with other themes or plugins. The plugin provides hooks and filters that allow you to modify or add your own code to the plugin, and create custom features or integrations. You can also use the plugin‚Äôs documentation and support to learn more about the plugin‚Äôs API and how to use it.

- **Completely integrated with the WooCommerce plugin**

  You can use the plugin with the WooCommerce plugin, and it will work perfectly. The plugin is built to enhance the WooCommerce plugin, and does not interfere with any of its features or settings. You can use the plugin to create and display swatches for your WooCommerce products, and enjoy all the benefits of the WooCommerce plugin, such as inventory management, order processing, payment gateways, shipping methods, and more.

- **Support the default exporter and importer of WooCommerce**

  Swatches data will be included with other product data when you export or import with the default tool of WooCommerce. This will save you time and effort, and ensure consistency across your WooCommerce store.

- **It is lightweight and has minimal impact on your website‚Äôs performance**

  The plugin is lightweight and optimized for speed. The plugin does not load any unnecessary files or scripts, and uses caching and minification techniques to reduce the load time and bandwidth usage. The plugin also follows the WordPress coding standards and best practices, and ensures the security and stability of your website.
